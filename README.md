## üöÄ Getting Started

This repository provides the foundational code and resources to interact with My Country Mobile services.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) (version X.X or higher - *specify your required version*)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos)
* [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) or any compatible database system.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Mycountrymobile-com/my-country-mobile.git](https://github.com/Mycountrymobile-com/my-country-mobile.git)
    cd my-country-mobile
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    If you're using PHP and Composer, install the required packages:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
    *(Add instructions for other tech stacks if applicable)*

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    * Create a `.env` file by copying the example file (if one is provided, e.g., `.env.example`).
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Alternatively, edit `config/config.php` (or your primary configuration file).
    * Update the file with your:
        * Database credentials (host, port, database name, username, password)
        * External API keys (e.g., for SMS services)
        * Other environment-specific settings.

4.  **Database Setup:**
    Connect to your MySQL instance and execute the following SQL commands to create the necessary database and tables:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mycountrymobile;

    USE mycountrymobile;

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- Added NOT NULL and UNIQUE for better data integrity
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        user_id INT,
        content TEXT NOT NULL,
        status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending', -- Example: 'pending', 'sent', 'failed'
        sent_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL -- Consider your referential integrity needs
    );
    ```
    *Note: The schema has been slightly enhanced for common use cases (e.g., timestamps, status for messages, constraints).*

### Running the Application

To start the application locally for development purposes using PHP's built-in server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view the application.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
This repository includes example implementations demonstrating core functionalities:

SMS Sending: Refer to public/index.php for a basic example of how to send SMS messages using our services. The SmsService.php class (or equivalent) encapsulates the logic for interacting with the SMS API.
User Management: The application demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users.
Message Logging: Sent and received messages (if applicable) can be logged to the database for tracking and analytics.
(Consider adding more detailed examples or links to specific files/modules for key functionalities.)
